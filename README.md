This is a four man group project to build search engine project (like a scaled-down version of Lucene). 

Project Sketch:

* The project will offer an application programmer interface (API) rather than a web-based browser search functionality.
* The application programmer interface will also be used to enter items into the searchable database - there is no notion of a "web crawler" or automated background process to build up content.
* Unit tests for all files
* The interface will be field-oriented, somewhat like Lucene, which offers the ability to index and query based on fields of a document or even parts of a document.
* Part of the search engine will have persistent storage (something like a primitive database), though initial implementations may not have this feature.
* During the semester, the project will get more refined, with different kinds of fields, different query types, perhaps ways to express queries with string expressions, and more.
* Time permitting, the project will have sample user programs that call upon the API, and use it to create more end-user friendly interfaces than the basic API.
